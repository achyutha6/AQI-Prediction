# 🌫️ AQI Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting **Air Quality Index (AQI)** using machine learning techniques based on environmental and pollution-related parameters. The model helps in understanding air pollution trends and estimating AQI values for better environmental monitoring.

## 📌 Project Overview
Air pollution is a major environmental issue affecting human health. This project uses historical air quality data to train a machine learning model that predicts AQI levels accurately.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn
